Hotels: Consistent quality, daily cleaning, on-site amenities, loyalty points. Higher cost per night. Best for shorter stays and those valuing convenience.

Hostels: Cheapest option, social atmosphere, kitchen access. Shared spaces and potential noise. Best for solo budget travelers and social seekers.

Airbnb/Vacation Rentals: Kitchen saves money on meals, space for groups, local neighborhood feel. Inconsistent quality, cleaning fees make short stays expensive. Best for families, groups, or stays over 4-5 nights.

Location matters more than accommodation type: A budget hotel in a great location beats a luxury hotel requiring 45-minute commutes.
