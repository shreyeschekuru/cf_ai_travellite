Budget Travel Tips for Stretching Your Money

Research Affordable Destinations: Not all destinations cost the same. Choose places where your money goes further.

Travel in Non-Peak Seasons: Traveling during shoulder or off-season can save significant money on flights and accommodations.

Go Where It's Cheap Not Where It's Trendy: If you're truly focused on saving money, don't start by picking a destination and hoping for a deal. Instead decide on where to go based on price.

Use Public Transportation Instead of Taxis and Ubers: Public transportation is almost always cheaper and often free. It's easy to keep track of where buses, trains and trams take you if you use Google Maps to plan your route.

Walk as Often as Possible: Even if you aren't on a budget, walking is almost always preferable to driving when visiting a new location. You see more and experience the city authentically.

Pay in Local Currency on Credit Card Transactions: Avoid dynamic currency conversion fees by always paying in the local currency.

Focus on Free Activities: Many cities offer free walking tours, parks, beaches and museums with free entry days.

Indulge in Street Food and Other Cheap Eats: Street food is authentic, affordable and often the best local flavors.

Stay in Accommodations That Offer Free Meals: Hostels or hotels with free breakfast can save you money daily.

Pack Camping Gear or Consider Van Life: For extended trips, alternative accommodations can drastically cut costs.
