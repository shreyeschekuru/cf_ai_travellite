Money Management While Traveling

Don't rely solely on credit cards. While convenient, some places may not accept cards or may charge fees. Always carry some local currency.

Withdraw local currency from trusted ATMs rather than airport currency exchanges which often have poor rates.

Not preparing for unexpected expenses is a common mistake. Build a buffer into your budget for surprises.

Forgetting time zones can affect banking and card usage. Know what time it is back home when you need to access accounts or make payments.

Don't assume you can't afford the vacation you want. With research and flexibility, many dream destinations are more affordable than expected.

Use a VPN when searching for flights. Some airlines and booking sites show different prices based on your location.
