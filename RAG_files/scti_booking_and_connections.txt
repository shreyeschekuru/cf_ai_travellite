Booking Flights and Connection Times

Booking flights too close together is tempting. After all, you don't want to eat up too much time getting to your destination. But this strategy can backfire. Any delay in your flights could throw off the rest of your trip.

Where possible, try to give yourself at least a two-hour layover so you have time to get through security, grab some food and stretch your legs before the next flight, without the stress of rushing to the gate.

This also means you have a buffer if your flight is slightly delayed. International connections often require even more time for customs and immigration.

Book your plane tickets far in advance for better prices. However, be flexible with dates if possible to find the best deals.
