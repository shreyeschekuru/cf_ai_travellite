For weekend trips (2-3 days): Focus on one neighborhood or district. Pick 2-3 must-see attractions and leave time for spontaneous exploration. Prioritize walkability over trying to cover too much ground.

For week-long trips (5-7 days): Explore 2-3 distinct neighborhoods or areas. Mix major attractions with local experiences. Build in at least one "rest day" or half-day for flexibility.

For extended trips (10+ days): Consider day trips to nearby cities or regions. Establish a home base and explore different areas each day. Allow for unplanned discoveries and local recommendations.
