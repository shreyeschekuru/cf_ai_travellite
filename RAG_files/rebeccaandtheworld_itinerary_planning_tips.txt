Itinerary Planning Tips

Highlight anything that you must do. These are the things that you absolutely will not compromise on and that must go into your travel itinerary.

Highlight in a different color the things that you'd like to see and do if you have time but these aren't must-dos.

Delete anything that's duplicated in your research.

Plot everything on Google Maps to divide a big city into areas. Plan an itinerary for your first day based around all the stuff to do in one section of the city, and then plan out day two based on what there is to do in another section.

Write out a rough itinerary for each day with a few backup options from your like-to-do list if you end up having more time on that day. Keep it flexible though.

Unless it's a busy travel period, you don't have to book every night of your trip. But it does help to book the first few nights for peace of mind.
