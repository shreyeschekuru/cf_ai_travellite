Trip Organization and Research

Be organized. This means not waiting to the last minute to sort out your plans. If you plan ahead and stay organized with your information, the trip is bound to go more smoothly.

A dose of spontaneity is always helpful on a trip, but too much spontaneity can lead to disaster. Spend time sorting out the details of your travel.

Some museums require advanced bookings including a prescribed time of arrival. If you leave details like these until the last minute, you might miss out on once in a lifetime experiences.

Research the cities you plan to visit. This can be the most exciting step of the planning process. Look up travel guides for your specific destination and start making a bucket list of activities.

Seek advice from friends who have visited your destination to help you sort through the must-see spots. Post questions on travel forums to get responses from locals and other travelers.

Keep a running list of your favorite destinations as well as events and activities you'd like to do there. Then begin to narrow down that list by deciding how far you're willing to travel, how much you're willing to spend, the safety and climate of each destination, and your must-do activities.
