Downtown/City Center: Best for first-time visitors. Walking distance to major attractions. Higher prices but maximum convenience. Can be touristy and loud.

Historic Districts: Charm and character. Often walkable with good dining. May lack modern amenities. Great for culture enthusiasts.

Trendy/Hip Neighborhoods: Local cafes, boutiques, nightlife. More authentic local experience. May be farther from major tourist sites. Good for repeat visitors.

Residential Areas: Quiet, affordable, local feel. Requires more transit time to attractions. Best for longer stays or those seeking authentic neighborhood life.

Near Transit Hubs: Easy access to different parts of the city. Can be noisy. Good compromise between price and accessibility.
