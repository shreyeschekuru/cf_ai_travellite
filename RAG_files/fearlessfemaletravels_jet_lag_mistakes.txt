Jet Lag and First Day Planning

Studies have found that if your flight crosses three or more time zones, it's likely to result in some jet lag. Jet lag manifests through symptoms like fatigue, anxiety, irritability, difficulty sleeping or waking up, stomach problems and just generally not feeling like yourself.

Plan lighter activities for the first day after long flights. Avoid important reservations or long tours on arrival day.

One of the most common travel mistakes is that novice travelers expect to do way too much on the first day of their trip. Give yourself time to adjust.

While you want to book your key attractions in advance, you don't want to make the mistake of pre-planning every single minute of your trip. Leave room for spontaneity and rest.
