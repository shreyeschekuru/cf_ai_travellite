Exploring Beyond Tourist Traps

Another common travel mistake is staying on the beaten path during your holiday. Popular tourist destinations tend to be crowded, overpriced and a bit inauthentic. While you'll probably want to hit a few of these attractions, make an effort to wander further afield as well.

Research your destination thoroughly so you know of any lesser-known attractions in the area. Once you've arrived, talk to the locals. They'll be able to point you to local favorites that tourists don't often know about.

Don't rely solely on ratings and review sites like TripAdvisor. While helpful, they can lead everyone to the same overcrowded spots.

Consult with locals for budget-friendly recommendations. They know where to eat, what to see and how to experience their city authentically.

Don't assume guided group tours aren't for you. Sometimes local guides can take you to places you'd never find on your own.
