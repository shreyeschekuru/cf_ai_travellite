Breakfast: Save money by eating at your accommodation or grabbing pastries/coffee from local bakeries. Hotel breakfasts often aren't worth the premium.

Lunch: Best value meal of the day. Many restaurants offer lunch specials at half the dinner price. Great time to try nicer restaurants affordably.

Dinner: Make reservations in advance for popular spots. Explore neighborhoods away from tourist centers for better value. Ask locals for recommendations.

Markets and Street Food: Authentic, affordable, and often the best local flavors. Research food safety for your destination. Great for breakfast and lunch.

Dietary Restrictions: Research ahead for cities that may have limited options. Use apps like HappyCow (vegetarian/vegan) or find local equivalents.
