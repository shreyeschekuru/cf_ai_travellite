Trip Duration Planning Best Practices

Only got a weekend? Then pick just one city. Focus on one neighborhood or district and avoid trying to cover too much ground.

A week? Find a city, maybe two if they're in close proximity, and use it as a base for exploring and taking day trips.

Two weeks? Travel around a small country or a smaller region of a country. Don't try to jam too much in.

One month? You could travel around a larger country or choose specific regions in one or two smaller countries.

More than a month? This gives you many options but again don't try to jam too much in. Quality over quantity.
