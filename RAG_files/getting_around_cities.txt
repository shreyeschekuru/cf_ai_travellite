Walking: Best for dense, walkable cities. Plan for 2-3 miles per day comfortably, up to 5-6 for active travelers. Use walking as sightseeing.

Public Transit: Research day passes vs. pay-per-ride. Download local transit apps. Learn the system on day one with a practice route. Saves money and provides local experience.

Ride-shares: Use for late nights, luggage-heavy trips, or when transit doesn't serve your destination well. Compare Uber/Lyft with local alternatives. Split rides to save money.

Bikes/Scooters: Great for medium distances in bike-friendly cities. Check local rules and bike lane infrastructure. E-bikes extend range significantly.

Car Rentals: Necessary for rural areas or multi-city road trips. Avoid for dense urban cores where parking is expensive and traffic is heavy.
