Over-scheduling: Trying to see too much leads to exhaustion and poor experiences. Build in buffer time and spontaneity.

Ignoring jet lag: Plan lighter activities for the first day after long flights. Avoid important reservations or long tours on arrival day.

Skipping travel insurance: Medical emergencies and trip cancellations happen. Budget travel insurance costs less than one nice dinner.

Not checking entry requirements: Visa requirements, vaccination records, passport validity (often needs 6 months beyond travel dates).

Carrying too much: Pack light. You can buy forgotten items at your destination. Heavy bags reduce mobility and enjoyment.

Ignoring local customs: Research tipping culture, dress codes for religious sites, business hours, and local etiquette.
